## ✨ Features

- **Multi-account support** — upload CSV or PDF statements from any number of accounts simultaneously
- **AI categorization** — Claude automatically categorizes transactions into 14 categories (income, groceries, dining, transport, rent, utilities, entertainment, health, shopping, savings, investment, travel, education, other)
- **Smart clarification** — recurring unknown merchants are surfaced for user confirmation; one-off unknowns default to "other"
- **Memory** — confirmed merchant mappings are saved locally; next upload is faster and smarter
- **Interactive dashboard** — spending by category, income vs expenses by month, net savings trend, filterable transaction table
- **Privacy first** — only transaction descriptions (not amounts) leave your machine for AI categorization. No data stored on any server.
- **Download** — export your fully categorized transactions as CSV

## 🏦 Supported Bank Statement Formats

**CSV:** Any export with date, description, and amount columns. Handles:
- Single amount column (positive/negative values)
- Separate debit + credit columns
- Date formats: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YYYY`

**PDF:** Text-based PDFs from most major banks. Note: scanned/image PDFs are not supported — export as CSV from your bank's online portal instead.

**Tested with:** Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac, NAB, ING, Macquarie

## 🔒 Privacy

- Your bank statement files are parsed locally — they are never uploaded to any server
- Only transaction **descriptions** (e.g. "WOOLWORTHS SUPERMARKET") are sent to the Anthropic API for categorization — amounts, dates, and account details stay on your machine
- Merchant mappings are saved to a local `data/mappings.json` file on your machine only

## 🧠 How the AI Agent Works

This project demonstrates a **LangChain-style ReAct agent pattern** implemented with the Anthropic Claude API:

1. **Parse tool** — extracts transactions from uploaded files into a standard schema
2. **Categorize tool** — sends transaction descriptions to Claude in batches; returns structured JSON category labels
3. **Memory tool** — persists confirmed user mappings; applied before LLM calls to reduce API usage
4. **Clarification agent** — manages multi-turn conversation state to resolve ambiguous merchants
5. **Dashboard** — renders Plotly charts from the fully categorized DataFrame

The categorizer uses **structured output prompting** — Claude is instructed to return only a JSON array with no preamble, which is then validated and parsed.
